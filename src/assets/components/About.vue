      <p>Hi!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Johan and I am 26 years old web developer. 
        I am originally from a small town in northern Sweden called 
        Hudiksvall but as of 2016 I have resided in Gothenburg. I'm 
        currently studying web development at IT-h√∂gskolan in Gothenburg 
        which i will graduate this may. Although I have spent most of my
        time in WordPress I must say that what interests me the most is 
        JavaScript and its frameworks. I have spent much of my free time 
        learning Vue, Express and React Native. And if I had to pick between
        frontend and backend I would have to say both.
      </p>
