# Portfolio
My portfolio page made by me.
Built with Nodejs, Vue and Express. The reasons i used the following 
frameworks was so i could familiarize myself more with them. I also wanted to
have the experiance of deploying a nodejs app. For this I used a ubuntu virtual server,
NGINX and Lets Encrypt for SSL.

If you would like to take a look on the page just visit www.johanwestin.com.
